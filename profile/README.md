## Hello there! 👋

We are a new, growing foundation driven by a simple but vital mission: providing a reliable, independent home for opensource projects.
Our goal is to be more than just a hosting provider; we want to be a cornerstone in a future, federated network of forges standing alongside
fantastic community efforts like Codeberg and our platform's core Forgejo.
